Total Marks: 5, q1: 2 marks, q2 3 marks
For this assignment you are task with two problems.:

1. Print your personal information to the console
   a. Create variable to hold some your information seen below.
   b. Output:

   ******* My Personal Information *******
   Name: Ahmed Dicko
   Age: 18

   ```

2. Make use of all the operators you have learned from Mathematics: Addition,
   Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division Create two variables of type int
   namely; a and b and assign them any of your desired values. Perform each
   operation in a separate print statement(`System.out.println(a+" + " +b+ " = " +(a+b));)`. Your assignment must have four print statements each doing a specific operation. At the end of the day your program should display the result of each operation in the console.
   a. Output:

   ```java
   10 + 2 = 12
   10 - 2 = 8
   10 * 2 = 20
   10 / 2 = 5
   ```

   Happy coding!
